# Contest Shot Analysis – Sport Analytics Project

## Overview
This project analyzes how defensive contests affect basketball shooting outcomes.
The dataset was manually collected by watching five basketball games and recording
shot attempts, contest characteristics, and results.

## Repository Contents
- `data/`: Manually collected shot dataset
- `code/`: R scripts and R Markdown used to generate exploratory figures
- `report/`: Final project paper (PDF)
- `presentation/`: Project presentation slides

## My Contribution
- Watched a San Antonio Spurs vs. Phoenix Suns basketball match to manually collect shot data for the dataset
- Contributed to defining and engineering key variables (eg. contest level, defender distance) for analysis
- Co-developed R code for exploratory figures
- Led the written summary and interpretation of results
- Coordinated with teammates, contributing to data consistency and team discussions
- Communicated findings clearly through the project presentation
  
## Notes
This was a team-based class project. The code and analysis included here reflect
the portions I worked on; additional analysis was completed collaboratively by teammates.
